# Wo ist das Hagelrisiko in der Schweiz für die Autoversicherer höher?

## Background
Switzerland is no stranger to extreme weather conditions, including hailstorms, which can occur throughout the year, not just during the winter months. Hailstorms can cause significant damage to vehicles, leading to increased costs for car owners and insurers alike. 

## Business Case
To better understand the risk of hail damage to vehicles in Switzerland, this project aims to combine the hail dataset with car registration data for each canton. By analyzing this data, we can identify the areas where the risk of hail damage is higher, providing valuable insights for car owners and insurers alike. This information can be used to adjust insurance premiums, helping insurers to better manage their risk and potentially reduce costs for car owners.
